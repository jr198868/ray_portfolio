# Raymond Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Getting Started 🚀
### How to check my portfolio on local computer 🚀

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:jr198868/ray_portfolio.git 

$ npm install package.json

$ cd ray_portfolio/

$ npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.




### `npm run build` 🚀

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
